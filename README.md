Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions.

Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Handled class imbalance using oversampling techniques.
Model Development: Implemented logistic regression and random forests.
Evaluation: Used precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.
Files
credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the full implementation.
data/creditcard.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
Demo

Movie Rating Prediction
Overview
In this project, I developed a model to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, and cast.

Highlights
Data Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key features.
Feature Engineering: Selected and processed features relevant to movie ratings.
Model Building: Utilized regression techniques to build the prediction model.
Files
movie_rating_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the complete implementation.
data/movies.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
Demo

Iris Flower Classification
Overview
This classic project involves classifying Iris flowers into species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Highlights
Data Exploration: Analyzed the Iris dataset for insights and patterns.
Model Training: Developed a classification model using logistic regression.
Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy in species classification.
