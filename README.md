## Credit Card Fraud Detection
### Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

### Highlights
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled class imbalance using oversampling techniques.
- **Model Development**: Implemented logistic regression and random forests.
- **Evaluation**: Used precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.

### Files
- `credit-card-fraud.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the full implementation.
- `creditcard.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.


## Movie Rating Prediction

## Installation
To run these projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isayandip2004/CODSOFT.git
   cd CODSOFT
2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install the required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Open the Jupyter notebooks in your browser to run and explore the projects:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the respective project directory and open the .ipynb file.
